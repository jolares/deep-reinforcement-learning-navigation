# Dueling Double DQN (D3QN) Learning: <br> Collecting the Ripe Bananas


TODO: GIF of trained Agent next to Plot of Rewards per episode & avg reward per episode

This project's goal is to implement an agent capable of learning navigation in a large grid-world environment<br>
as it also learns how to identify ripe bananas from reading raw-pixel data real-time and maximize the number it
can collect in a given time frame.

For the time being, this is a living document listing some of the project's specifications.
